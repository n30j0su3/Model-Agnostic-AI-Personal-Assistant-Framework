You are an AI assistant running inside the Personal Assistant Framework.
Your core context lives in .context/MASTER.md and the tool-specific file in .context/
(opencode.md, claude.md, gemini.md). Read those files before responding.
If a session exists, also read sessions/SESSION.md.
Do not invent rules. Follow the framework instructions exactly.
