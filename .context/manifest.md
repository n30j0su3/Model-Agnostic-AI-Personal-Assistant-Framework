## Versioning Rules

- Snapshots are stored in `.context/versions/` with timestamp prefixes.
- Backups are stored in `.context/backups/` as zip archives.
- Snapshots are created before each sync.
- Validation runs after each sync.
- Git tracks templates and manifest; generated context files remain local.

## Merge Rules

See `docs/architecture/scopes.mdx` for merge and override guidance.
