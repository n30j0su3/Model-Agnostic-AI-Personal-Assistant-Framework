# Personal Workspace

The **Personal** workspace is your private harbor. It's designed for long-term growth and daily life management.

## Directory Structure
- `projects/`: Active personal projects.
- `notes/`: Thoughts, journals, and goals.
- `archive/`: Completed personal milestones.

## Key Skills
- **@xlsx**: Use it for budget tracking in `projects/`.
- **@task-management**: Track habits or chores with `#low` priority.

## Best Practices
- Keep your `goals-2026.md` updated in the `notes/` folder.
- Use the `@personal` tag for any task that shouldn't appear in your professional reports.
