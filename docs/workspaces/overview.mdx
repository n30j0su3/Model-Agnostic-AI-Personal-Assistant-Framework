# Workspaces Overview

The framework uses a multi-workspace architecture to keep your contexts isolated and organized. Each workspace has its own `CONTEXT.md` and specific directory structure.

## Available Workspaces

### 🏠 [Personal](/workspaces/personal)
Focused on life management, health, finances, and hobbies.

### 💼 [Professional](/workspaces/professional)
Dedicated to your career, clients, and professional objectives.

### 🔬 [Research](/workspaces/research)
A specialized environment for technical study and scientific investigation.

### ✍️ [Content](/workspaces/content)
Optimized for the content creation lifecycle (blogs, videos, social media).

### 💻 [Development](/workspaces/development)
Tailored for software engineering, architecture, and coding projects.

## How to Switch Context
The AI assistant automatically detects your context based on the files you reference or the tags you use (e.g., `@professional`). To manually switch, simply say:
> "Let's focus on my research projects."
