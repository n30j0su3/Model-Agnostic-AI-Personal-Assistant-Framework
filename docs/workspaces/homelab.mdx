# Homelab Workspace

The **Homelab** workspace is dedicated to self-hosted infrastructure, networking, and operational automation.

## Directory Structure
- `inventory/`: Hardware, IPs, and topology snapshots.
- `services/`: Service catalog and dependencies.
- `automation/`: Scripts for provisioning, backups, and routines.
- `projects/`: Infrastructure initiatives and upgrades.
- `notes/`: Maintenance logs and change notes.
- `archive/`: Retired services and completed upgrades.

## Key Skills
- **@task-management**: Track maintenance work with clear priorities.
- **@mcp-builder**: Design integrations for homelab services.
- **@code-reviewer**: Review automation scripts for safety.

## Best Practices
- Document every change in `notes/maintenance.md` before deployment.
- Keep secrets out of the workspace; use environment variables or vaults.
- Validate uptime and backups after each change window.
