# Introduction

Welcome to the **Model-Agnostic AI Personal Assistant Framework**.

This is a professional framework designed to manage, optimize, and improve productivity using open-source best practices and local context management.

## Core Philosophy

> "I own my context."

The framework is built on the belief that your AI interactions are most powerful when the context is stored locally, in plain text, and remains independent of any specific AI model or vendor.
