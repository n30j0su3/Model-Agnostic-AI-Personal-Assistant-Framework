# Quickstart

Get your AI Personal Assistant up and running in a few simple steps.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Git**
- **Python 3.10+**

### Recommended AI Terminals

We recommend installing at least two of the following to experience the multi-tool workflow:

```bash
# OpenCode (Primary)
npm install -g opencode-ai

# Gemini CLI (Research)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/gemini-cli

# Claude Code (Advanced Agents)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

## Installation

1. **Get the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/n30j0su3/Model-Agnostic-AI-Personal-Assistant-Framework.git
   cd Model-Agnostic-AI-Personal-Assistant-Framework
   ```

   If you downloaded the ZIP instead of cloning, extract it and enter the folder.

2. **Run the Launcher**
   ```bash
   ./pa.sh
   ```

   On Windows, run `pa.bat`. On first run (no `.git` yet), the launcher runs the installer and can initialize a repo for you:
   - GitHub (private + sync)
   - Local Git only
   - Sandbox (no Git)
   The installer also asks for language and default CLI selection.
   If Python or Git are missing, the launcher guides installation on Windows.
   If OpenCode is selected and Node.js is missing, the installer guides Node.js setup.
   See the [Smart Repository Setup](/setup/repo-setup) guide for details.

3. **Initialize your Profile**
   Open `.context/MASTER.md` and update it with your personal information, preferences, and timezone.

4. **Start your First Session**
   Launch your preferred AI terminal (e.g., `opencode`) and say:
   > "Buenos días, iniciemos la sesión de hoy."

   If the AI does not load the framework, use the magic prompt shown by the launcher:
   > "Read .context/opencode.md and start the session."

## First Steps

- **Sync Context**: If you use multiple tools, run `python scripts/sync-context.py`.
- **Explore Workspaces**: Navigate to `workspaces/` to see how contexts are separated.
- **Check Progress**: Look at `sessions/SESSION.md` to track your work.

## Troubleshooting (Windows)

If PowerShell blocks `opencode` with a policy error, run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
```

## Feature Sessions

When you want to plan or implement backlog features, activate the Feature Architect agent:

> "Feature Session mode. Activate @feature-architect."

You can also ask it to evaluate a specific item:

> "@feature-architect, evaluate BL-044"

## Uninstall

Need to remove the framework? See the [Uninstall](/uninstall) guide.
