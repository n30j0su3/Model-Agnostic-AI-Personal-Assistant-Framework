# Multi-Model Orchestration (Optional)

This feature is **optional**. It does not replace the native configuration of each terminal
(OpenCode plan/build modes, Claude settings, Gemini CLI flags, etc.). It only manages a
local `.context/models.md` file for people who want a single place to switch models quickly.

## Do I need this?

### You probably do NOT need it if:
- You prefer to use each terminal independently.
- You already manage models in the native config of each tool.
- You only use one model or provider.

### It can help if:
- You switch models frequently depending on the task.
- You want one command to change your primary/fallback model.
- You want a shared reference for teams or multi-machine setups.

## How to enable

```bash
python scripts/orchestrate.py init
```

This creates `.context/models.md` with a default catalog and active model selection.

## Core commands

```bash
python scripts/orchestrate.py status
python scripts/orchestrate.py list
python scripts/orchestrate.py switch claude-sonnet
python scripts/orchestrate.py switch --fallback gemini-pro
python scripts/orchestrate.py recommend "debug error en api"
python scripts/orchestrate.py disable
```

## How recommendations work

The `recommend` command uses a simple keyword map. It is intentionally basic and local.
You can still override it by switching the model manually.

## Notes

- If `models.md` does not exist, the commands will warn you and do nothing.
- The feature is safe to ignore; your existing workflows keep working as-is.
