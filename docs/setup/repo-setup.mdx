# Smart Repository Setup

The framework can bootstrap a repository the first time you run the installer. This makes onboarding friendlier for non-technical users while still working in offline-only setups.

## When It Runs

`scripts/install.py` triggers the setup flow only if:

- The project has no `.git/` directory yet.
- Git is available.
- A global Git identity is configured (user name or email).

If those checks fail, the installer keeps going without interruption.

## Setup Modes

You will be prompted to choose one of the following modes:

1. **GitHub (private + sync)**
   - Creates a private repository and pushes the initial commit.
   - Recommended for backups and multi-device workflows.

2. **Local Git only**
   - Initializes Git locally and creates the first commit.
   - Good for privacy-first or offline users.

3. **Sandbox (no Git)**
   - Skips Git entirely and avoids extra files.
   - Ideal for quick tests or experiments.

## Compatibility Cascade

To maximize compatibility and minimize dependencies, the setup flow uses this order:

1. **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** when installed and authenticated.
2. **PyGithub** when the library is available in the environment.
3. **GitHub REST API** (native `urllib`) as a universal fallback.

Tokens are requested via hidden prompt and never stored.

## Manual Usage

If you need to run the setup again or if the installer didn't run it automatically, follow these simple steps:

1. **Open your Command Console**:
   - **Windows**: Search for `cmd` or `PowerShell` in the Start menu.
   - **macOS/Linux**: Open the `Terminal` app.
2. **Navigate to the framework folder** (or open the terminal directly inside it).
3. **Paste and run this command**:

```bash
python scripts/setup_repo.py
```

### Tips for beginners
- If you see an error about `python` not being found, try using `python3` instead.
- You can copy the command above by clicking the copy icon in the Cockpit Dashboard.

## Notes

- The repo name defaults to the current folder name.
- Visibility defaults to private.
- `.gitignore` is ensured before committing.
