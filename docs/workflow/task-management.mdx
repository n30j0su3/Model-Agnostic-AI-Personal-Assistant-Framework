# Task Management

Our framework uses a multidisciplinary task tagging system to keep your lists clean across all areas of your life.

## How to Tag Tasks

The standard format for a task is:
`- [ ] Description @workspace #priority`

### Workspaces (`@`)
- `@personal`: Home, hobbies, health.
- `@professional`: Career, clients, work.
- `@research`: Studies, papers.
- `@content`: Blogs, videos.
- `@development`: Code, DevOps.

### Priorities (`#`)
- `#high`: Urgent or critical.
- `#medium`: Standard tasks.
- `#low`: Backlog or "nice to have".

## Useful Commands

| Command | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Add task [X] @professional" | Creates a professional task. |
| "List all @research tasks" | Filters and shows research tasks. |
| "Show my #high priority tasks" | Shows everything urgent. |

## Automation
The `@task-management` skill uses `manage-tasks.py` to scan all your workspace files and the current session to give you a unified view of your responsibilities.
