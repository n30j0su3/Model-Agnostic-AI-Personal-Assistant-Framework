# Feature Sections

The "Seccion Rapida de Caracteristicas" is a fast loop for improving the framework while dogfooding its own workflow. Use it when you want to advance features and keep the system consistent.

## Quick Flow

1. Review and update the backlog in `docs/backlog.md`.
2. Regenerate the filtered view in `docs/backlog.view.md`.
3. Work inside the current session file `sessions/SESSION.md`.
4. Document any new behavior or changes (short, focused notes).
5. Run a privacy check before deploys:
   - Confirm private files are covered in `.gitignore`.
   - Verify only safe files are staged.
6. Sync changes to remotes only after the checks pass.

## Suggested Commands

```bash
python scripts/sync-remotes.py --private-remote origin
```

```bash
python scripts/publish-release.py --push
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- Backlog updated and filtered view regenerated.
- Session reflects the feature section work.
- Documentation updated for any new behavior.
- Privacy checks completed before any GitHub sync.
