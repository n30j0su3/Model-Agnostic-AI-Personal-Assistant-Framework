# Contribution & Feature Request Protocol

To maintain a clean separation between the **Core Framework** and **User Data**, all contributions and feature requests must adhere to this protocol. This ensures that personal information never pollutes the public codebase.

## 1. The "No-Pollution" Policy

**NEVER** commit or push the following to the public `upstream` repository:
-   `sessions/*.md` (Your daily interactions).
-   `logs/` (Execution logs, debug traces).
-   `.context/` (Unless submitting a generic template).
-   `workspaces/` (Your personal files).
-   `.env` or any file containing API Keys.

The public repository should contain **only** the generic framework logic:
-   `agents/`
-   `skills/`
-   `scripts/`
-   `docs/`

## 2. Standardized Feature Requests (PRs)

We prioritize feature requests submitted as Pull Requests (PRs) over simple issue tickets. A standard PR gets **+10% Priority Weight** in the backlog.

### How to Submit a Feature Request via PR

1.  **Create a Branch**:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/name-of-your-feature
    ```

2.  **Add Your Request**:
    Create a new file in `requests/` (create the folder if it doesn't exist) named `REQ-Title.md` with this format:

    ```markdown
    # Feature Request: [Title]

    ## Goal
    [What do you want to achieve?]

    ## Proposed Solution
    [How should it work?]

    ## Why is it critical?
    [Justification]
    ```

3.  **Clean Your Commit**:
    Ensure only the request file (and any proposed code changes) are staged.
    ```bash
    git add requests/REQ-Title.md
    git commit -m "feat: Request [Title]"
    ```

4.  **Push to Upstream**:
    Push your branch and open a PR against the `main` branch of the public repo.

## 3. Parallel Development & Sync

When working in a team or across multiple devices:

-   **Sync Often**: Use `python scripts/pa.py` -> Sync to pull latest changes.
-   **Resolve Conflicts Locally**: If `sessions/` conflict, manually merge the Markdown files.
-   **Private First**: Always push to `origin` (Private) first. Only push to `upstream` (Public) when you are ready to share a generic feature.

## 4. Development Logs

Development logs (`logs/dev/`) are strictly for local debugging or private history.
-   **Public Repo**: Contains only `logs/.example` to show the expected format.
-   **Private Repo**: May contain your full history.

**Compliance Check**:
Before submitting a PR, run:
```bash
python scripts/context-validate.py --clean-check
```
(This script ensures no private paths are staged).
