# Session Management

The **Daily Session** is the heartbeat of this framework. It ensures that every interaction is traceable and that no context is lost between days.

## The Daily Cycle

### 1. Starting the Day
Begin your day by greeting your assistant.
> "Buenos días, iniciemos la sesión de hoy."

**What happens:**
- The `@session-manager` agent reads `sessions/SESSION.md`.
- It analyzes pending tasks from yesterday.
- It asks you for today's **Focus**.

### 2. During the Day
As you work, keep your assistant updated.
- "Completed the architecture review."
- "I'm starting to work on the login feature."
- "Decision: We will use PostgreSQL for the database."

**What happens:**
- The `@session-tracking` skill logs your progress in real-time.
- Decisions are recorded in the `Notes & Decisions` section.

### 3. Closing the Day
When you are done, trigger the closing procedure.
> "Vamos a cerrar el día."

**What happens:**
- The `daily-summary.py` script generates a report.
- The assistant creates a historical archive in `sessions/YYYY/MM/DD.md`.
- The `@github-deployer` performs a final commit and push to GitHub.
