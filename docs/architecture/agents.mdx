# Agents

Agents are specialized AI instances with distinct instructions and fresh context windows.

## Core Agents

The framework includes several pre-built agents to handle system tasks:

### @session-manager
Responsible for daily productivity tracking, reminders, and end-of-day summaries. It interacts with the `sessions/` directory.

### @context-sync
Ensures that knowledge defined in `.context/MASTER.md` is correctly propagated to all tool-specific context files.

### @github-deployer
Automates the git workflow, creating descriptive commits and pushing changes to your remote repository.

## Creating Custom Agents

You can create your own specialized agents in the `agents/custom/` directory. Each agent should have an `AGENT.md` file following the system's template.

```markdown
---
name: your-agent-name
description: What the agent does
scope: workspace-name or global
tools: [list of tools]
---
# Instructions

```
