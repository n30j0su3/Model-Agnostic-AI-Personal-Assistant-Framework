# Context Management

The framework stores context locally in plain text files under `.context/`.
This keeps your knowledge portable and avoids vendor lock-in.

## Structure

Key files and folders:

- `.context/MASTER.md`: global preferences and rules
- `.context/{tool}.md`: tool-specific context (synced from MASTER)
- `.context/profile.md`: installation profile settings
- `.context/models.md`: optional multi-model orchestration config
- `.context/manifest.md`: structure and versioning rules
- `.context/versions/`: snapshots created before sync
- `.context/backups/`: full backups (zip)

## Versioning

Snapshots are created automatically before every sync. Use the utilities below
to create, list, restore, and compare snapshots.

```bash
python scripts/context-version.py snapshot
python scripts/context-version.py list
python scripts/context-version.py restore 2026-01-23_121212
python scripts/context-version.py diff 2026-01-23_121212
```

## Validation

After every sync, a validation pass checks for missing sections, markers, and
workspace mismatches.

```bash
python scripts/context-validate.py
```

## Maintenance and Backups

The versioning tool also handles cleanup and backups:

```bash
python scripts/context-version.py clean --older 30
python scripts/context-version.py export
python scripts/context-version.py import path/to/backup.zip
python scripts/context-version.py stats
python scripts/context-version.py delete 2026-01-23_121212
```

## Why it matters

- You can restore context quickly if a change goes wrong.
- You keep full control of your data locally.
- You can measure savings in tokens and effort over time.
