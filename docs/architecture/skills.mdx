# Skills

Skills are modular capabilities that agents can invoke to perform specific actions. Our framework follows the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).

## Available Skills

### @session-manager (integrated)
Session tracking is handled by the `@session-manager` agent, which logs tasks and updates in real-time.

### @task-management
A multidisciplinary task manager that supports `@workspace` tagging and `#priority` levels.

### @daily-summary
Extracts data from the current session to generate structured reports.

## Structure of a Skill

Each skill is a self-contained directory:

```
skills/core/skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Metadata and instructions
├── scripts/          # Executable code (Python/Bash)
├── references/       # Additional documentation
└── assets/           # Templates and static resources
```

## Adding Skills

To add a new skill, create a directory in `skills/custom/` and follow the standard structure. Use `python scripts/skill-sync.py` to update the global index.
