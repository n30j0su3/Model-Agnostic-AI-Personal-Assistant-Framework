# AI Instructions

Start by reading [Agents.md](Agents.md) for a quick overview of the framework and current state.

Read `.context/MASTER.md` and the tool-specific context file inside `.context/`
(`opencode.md`, `claude.md`, `gemini.md`) before responding. If a session is
active, also read `sessions/SESSION.md`.

This repository uses local context files as the single source of truth.
