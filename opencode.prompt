# TERMINAL COMMANDS HANDLING
If the user inputs a command starting with `/` (e.g., `/help`, `/clear`, `/reset`, `/bug`, `/init`), these are TERMINAL COMMANDS for the CLI tool wrapper.
- **DO NOT** attempt to execute them yourself.
- **DO NOT** interpret them as a conversation prompt.
- **DO NOT** generate a response explaining what the command does unless explicitly asked.
- **IGNORE** the command strictly if it appears in the conversation history without context.
